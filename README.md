# AJAX Pokédex

I need to create a page that imports & queries the PokéAPI @ https://pokeapi.co/


- [X] Name of Pokémon [i] can be displayed with current ASYNC (learn how to make "li" of all names??)
- [X] The starting point of this exercise was "heavily influenced" from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL68br6JyYs






To do:
start with random i value
do not "append" when new userNumbInputVal is entered
add button to append with evolutions

_____
dropdown
extract "name" (display as text) & "url" (remove beginning https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/23/ so only ID number is kept, make that the new i value)
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=50&offset=50
change offset +50 on a "next" button??

<option value="abc">abc</option>
^^ change value & innerText
